# Git Bash Button Plugin for Unreal Engine

- To use it, download the plugin at Releases and place the folder at pathTo\UE_5.6\Engine\Plugins\Marketplace\





This plugin adds a toolbar button to the Unreal Engine Level Editor that launches Git Bash. It automatically detects the installed path of Git Bash using the `where git` command, so it works across different system setups.


Press the Git Bash icon at the bottom left near save, and it will launch git-bash. You can also launch it by hitting Alt+X or another custom keybing of your choice.
